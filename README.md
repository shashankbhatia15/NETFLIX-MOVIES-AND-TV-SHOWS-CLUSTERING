I have clustered Netflix Movies And TV Shows Data with K-Means Clustring.

ðŸ’¾ Project Files Description
This Project includes 1 colab notebook, 1 technical documentation as well as 1 presentation:

Executable Files:
NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING.ipynb - Includes all functions required for classification operations.
Output:
Google Colab - All the outputs are visible in the provided colab notebook.
Data Source:
Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows
-----------------------------------------------------

ðŸ“– K-Means And Recommender System
I have used a K Means clustering with an optimal value of k=26 for clustering the Text Based Columns. The value of k was chosen from the elbow method and silhouette score.

-----------------------------------------------------

ðŸ“‹ Execution Instruction
The order of execution of the colab notebook is as follows:

1) NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING.ipynb

First, click on the open in colab button present on the top center of the notebook.

2) Kaggle Dataset

Downlaod the dataset from kaggle through provided link.Then, connect to the runtime and execute the cell to mount the drive or upload the data file to the current runtime.

3) Cell Path

Finally, delete the path in the dataset loading cell and replace it with the path of your current data file. Run each cell to see the output below it.
